# LoanTap-card-slot-exercise
This code has the "processCardEvents" function which receives a large batch of card events from multiple cards and returns only those which are valid transactions.

- Solution to the exercise is written in the "processCardEvents.js" file.
- "processCardEvents.js" will take the input of arrays in the variable "eventsArr" 
- Function => processCardEvents will take this input and console log the processed cards.
